* Trying to create this consistent habit of documenting weekly reflections, plus a collage of annotated pics taken within the week to hopefully restore the memory...? 
* Probably only going to stick to it after heading to uni. The plan should more or less *force* me to record life and consciously seize it (or else there'd still be these feelings of being such an ostrichy escapist,,,,). (AND perhaps even get motivated to *create a life* that's more fun to record..??)
    * By then the `/archives` section will preferably show a **continuous index** of blog post previews arranged by week number!! (and i'll be less of an ostrich (or at least a much more *organized* one))

`De-ostrichize` is just some weird made-up notion, special thanks to terms about modifications like dephosphorylation and stuff


// 好奇怪的碎碎念方式。但同上，即使没办法`去鸵鸟化`，能当一只更有条理的也挺好的

// 四月份的海口还是刚二十度出头，晚上走在海边会感觉，我要变成海风了！事实上显然并没有，是因为本体感受器这些还是在不停地输入吗。不知道。只知道春天真是太好了！
