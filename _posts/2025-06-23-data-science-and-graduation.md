I actually wrote this quite a while ago during my last few days of high school, but didn’t feel motivated to post it here for archive… ;w; Turns out, regularly documenting life is harder than I thought (not that I planned to keep it up rn anyway),,,, perhaps it's still better to stick with being an ostrich...

This month I’m back to studying organic chemistry (but CS is so extremely cool... still planning to move on and learn more about reinforcement learning after several more chapters of Clayden), so I thought it’d be worthwhile to reflect on this (mostly unexpected) trip into data science over the past semester. Keeping notes really helped me, and I’ve uploaded them all to my GitHub repo.

The whole thing started in early March, when I asked my Further Math teacher what subjects he’d recommend exploring with my post-offer free time (since I had virtually no exams to prep for in the entire semester ahead). I’m still incredibly grateful for his reply—he sent me a detailed list of topics, most of them in CS. I only briefly encountered deep learning back in 2023, and I didn’t think things like data analytics (which he recommended I learn first via a Chinese MOOC platform) was relevant to my future biochem major at first glance.

That particular course turned out to be the most engaging learning experience I’ve ever had, especially the ML part. It was still one of my most memorably happy times, despite still being solitary, being able to spend entire weekends in the district library, feeling so excited about all this new data stuff, messing around with code and rediscovering Python after forgetting most of it. I literally felt heartbroken the day I completed all lessons in the specialization—my last task was creating a word cloud. From then onwards I kept on learning data science (so the excitement lingers on!!)—in English this time and mostly via Coursera—and it continued to be fun and inspiring... I honestly feel so lucky my math teacher suggested it.

April was a productive month. The data analytics MOOC I took next focused on different areas compared to the previous one in March, more on hands-on skills like spreadsheets rather than intuitions on ML algorithms. I explored SQL and R for the first time (well,,, technically I had R installed back in 2023 in my hometown but was too scared to touch the syntax). I started by auditing the course, but when I realized I still had leftover money in PayPal (probably from old art commissions some years ago, sobs) I decided to enroll and get the certificate. I then began auditing the bioinformatics course from my math teacher’s list. It was a bit dated really, but highly relevant—when I later tackled some much more up-to-date RNA-seq practicals, I realized that the core ideas and algorithms in the course were still totally useful, even if some of the functions shown in the demos had been deprecated... so sad... :’)

So that was what I’d never expect to have touched at the start of the semester. By May I got to dive back into deep learning, this time in a much, much more systematic way than in the summer of 2023, when I (being childish and stupid) struggled to keep up with a research project that required heavy DL and programming skills. Much of that year still felt magical—everything was brand new and shimmering with hope: friends, math, biology with piles of college textbooks, and that project I had cold-emailed my way into. The project tutor was always so patient and supportive to me... I’ve never really had the chance to talk to him again afterwards—aside from holiday greetings—until this January, when he suddenly messaged me congrats on my offer. I was so touched...

ok i’m going off-topic. So let’s stay off-topic a bit longer.

I’ve changed schools quite a lot since I was small, so it seemed kinda natural for me not to feel too attached to my (second) high school. It was rather unique (and hard to imagine) though—we only had eight students in my year, even split into two classes. I’m really grateful for the teachers and the opportunities we had, as I was lucky enough to have three 1-on-1 classes: AP chem, interview prep, and the aforementioned Further Math. My chemistry teacher left at the beginning of this school-year (to another school that I considered special due to some other weird reasons), which really hit hard—she was so warm and gentle, and literally the only person at school who’d chat with me over stuff like prions; she was also the only person around me who supported me in attending the biology Olympiad camp in Nanchang last year, which ended up being ‘*the one the only*’ best experience of my entire high school life. Funny enough, even now, when I happen to see certain bioinformatics terms or graphs, memories flash back to that nostalgic (...?) conference room in Nanchang where lecturers were presenting slides I failed to understand back then… I actually plan to go back to Nanchang (just to relive those memories) on the only day-off during July when I head to Shanghai (to another learning camp,,, this time as a TA instead of a student OvO. my first job!!). 我要回南昌了！！

‘Ostrich (鸵鸟)’ was a nickname-like thingy given to me by my physics teacher once. I used to be pretty upset by it, thinking it was a euphemism of calling someone nerdy—a label (and an imprecise one -_-) that made me sad or feel inferior in the past, but over the years I’ve gotten over those feelings. I actually find the description quite funny now, and the phrase ‘ostrichy escapism’—why not?

I’ve been an ostrich in two places on campus—two quiet, comfy spots I’ll likely miss: the school library and Biology Lab #5 where I used to hide for weeks to try prepping for the experimental section of the national Olympiad. As for the library, it had these spiral-shaped plants (shown in the centre below) near the doorway, which I thought resembled twisted fried potatoes (旋风薯塔!!!) much more than, say, DNA double helices.

Ooooh and another thing I found quite enchanting during this data science trip... The word ‘*space*’ suddenly feels so vast and so unbounded: it’s no longer tied down to the confining x, y, and z of Cartesian coordinates… now practically anything—any feature—can become an axis in some high-dimensional space... this honestly gives a sense of breathtaking freedom. You could go anywhere!!!!
