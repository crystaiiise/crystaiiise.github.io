I actually wrote this quite a while ago during my last few days of high school, but didn’t feel motivated to post it here for archive... Turns out, documenting regularly is so much harder than I thought. Perhaps it's still better to stick with being an ostrich... ;v;

This month I went back to learning organic chem, so I thought it’d be worthwhile to reflect on this (mostly unexpected) trip into data science and ML over the past semester. The whole thing started in early March, when I asked my Further Math teacher what subjects I could explore as I had no more exams ahead. He sent over a list of topics (I was so lucky), and the first course he recommended was data analytics from a Chinese MOOC platform. That turned out to be the most engaging learning experience I’ve ever had, especially the ML part. Weird to say but it was still among one of my most memorably happy times, being able to spend full weekends in the library of the district I lived then, feeling thrilled about all the 'data' stuff, messing around with code and rediscovering Python after forgetting most of it (got quite upset the day I completed the specialization). From then onwards I kept on learning data science (so the excitement lingers on) — in English this time and mostly via Coursera, and it continued to be inspiring and fun. 

April was a rather productive month. The data analytics MOOC I took then focused on different areas compared to the one in March, more on hands-on skills like spreadsheets instead of intuitions on ML algorithms, and I got to explore SQL and R for the first time (I had R installed back in 2023 but wasn't courageous enough to pick up a new programming language...). The JHU bioinformatics course from the list was a bit dated, but still highly relevant — when I later ran some much more up-to-date RNA-seq practicals, I realized that the core ideas and algorithms in the course were totally useful, even if some of the functions shown in the demos had been deprecated... so sad...

So that was what I’d never expect to have touched at the start of the semester. By May I got to dive back into deep learning, this time in a much, much more systematic way than in the summer of 2023, when I (being childish and stupid) struggled to keep up with a research project that required heavy DL and programming skills. Much of that year of 2023 still felt magical — everything was brand new and shimmering with hope: friends, math, biology with piles of college textbooks, and that project I had cold-emailed my way into. The project tutor was so patient and supportive... I’ve never really had the chance to talk to him again afterwards..., until this January, when he suddenly messaged me congrats on my offer. I got so touched... ><

ok i’m going off-topic

Btw. The word ‘space’ feels so vast and so unbounded: it’s no longer tied down to the confining x, y, and z of Cartesian coordinates… now practically anything — any feature — can become an axis in some high-dimensional space... this honestly gives a sense of breathtaking freedom. You can go anywhere!!!
